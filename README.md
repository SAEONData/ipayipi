# ipayipi â€” data processing pipeline

- Build a traceable data pipeline
- Standardise, archive, and processing of time series data and metadata
- Top notch speed when handling `big data' using 'data.table'
- Advanced processing of groundwater data*
- Generic pipeline construction for open data

Currently, advanced groundwater and rainfall processing does not use the generic pipeline functions, but does follow the same principles. A merger of the advanced processing functions into the generic pipeline is under way.
