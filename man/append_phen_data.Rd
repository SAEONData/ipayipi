\arguments{
\item{station_file}{Path and filename of the station file.}

\item{sf_phen_ds}{Phenomena summary from the station file.}

\item{ndt}{Data from the new data file.}

\item{new_phen_ds}{Phenomena summary for the new data.}

\item{phen_dt}{Phenomena table of from both the station and new data files
combined. These are combined and phids standarised in
ipayipi::station_append().}

\item{overwrite_sf}{If \code{TRUE} then original data is disgarded
in favour of new data. If TRUE both data sets will be evaluated and where
there are NA values, a replacement, if available, will be used to replace
the NA value. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{tn}{The name of the phenomena data tables.}

\item{ri}{The record interval associated with the data sets. As a
standardised string.}
}
\value{
A phenomena table that contains the start and end dates of each
phenomena and the respective data source identification numbers of the
data. Also, the appended data.
}
\description{
This function is for internal use. The function is designed to
append phenomena data and associated phenomena standards efficiently, but
retaining metadata records for each phenomena. Moreover, the function
evaluates missing data and compares new and older data records so avoid
loosing data.
}
\details{
This function is an internal function called by others in the
pipeline.
